# Maya2018
This is a fork of the original scorza/variableFK.
It adds support for PySide2 by reformatting a couple of imports that changed after the migration from PySide to PySide2.
It should work in maya2018+.

Original readme:

# variableFK
UI for building a variable foward kinematic rig, after Jeff Brodsky. FK controls slide along length of the geo, allowing curves to push forward and back smoothly. Ideal for tentacles, elephant trunks, etc.

To open UI, open vfk_UI.py file in Maya script editor and run the entire block of code.
